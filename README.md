    <h1 style="color: blue;"> <strong> Objectives and Goal</strong></h1></div>

* To create a model that can automates EEG analysis will help doctors and brain researchers detect seizures and other types of brain activity that can cause brain damage, so that they can give treatments more quickly and accurately. 
* May also help researchers who are working to develop drugs to treat and prevent seizures.
* To detect and classify seizures and other types of harmful brain activity in critical ill patients.
* To develop a model trained on [EEG (Electroencephalography)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography) signals recorded from critically ill hospital patients.
